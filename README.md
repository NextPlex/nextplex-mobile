# NextPlex Mobile

This app is based on the Steroids multi-page app (MPA) demo app built with AngularJS.

## Running the app with Steroids
1. Install Steroids CLI [with these instructions](http://guides.appgyver.com/steroids/guides/steroids_npm/installing/).
2. Run `$ steroids update` in the project directory to install the require NodeJS modules and other libraries.
3. Run `$ steroids connect` in the project directory to start the local Steroids server. A QR code will open in your browser.
4. Connect with a client:
  1. Download [AppGyver Scanner for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appgyver-scanner/id575076515) or [AppGyver Scanner for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgyver.android&hl=en) and scan the QR code
  2. On OS X, you can also type `sim` in the Steroids console to open the iOS Simulator
5. As you edit your project's HTML files, press Enter in the Steroids console to push changes to all updated devices.
