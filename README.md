## Running this app on iOS

Downlaod the [AppGyver Scanner App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appgyver-scanner/id575076515?mt=8)
from the Apple App Store.

Visit our [AppGyver Share Link](https://share.appgyver.com/?id=11417&hash=841faf4e001b18a3d8119e2984082cc6f06cb468062998a516c3827794a4c170)
and scan the QR Code using the app you just downloaded.

## Running this app on Android

This app *can* run on Android, however, our testing did not cover this platform,
and we would not like to include this platform with our ATTROC hackathon submission

## Note about our app

We will continue to work on the app after the submission deadline of April 23rd
at midnight, however, we will freeze the provided AppGyver link so you will see 
our app "as-is" at the time of the submission deadline. Any modifications made
after that point will not be included with the version of the app linked to above.
